I started my career in Graphic Design and branched out into Environmental Science and eventually into Content Creation. Now I hope to combine both my worlds of Biology and Tech to utilize all of my chosen career paths. 

My background includes a Masterâ€™s in Biology and skills in Graphic Design, Advertising, Content Creation, and Statistical Analysis. My strengths that make me unique are the ability to conduct statistical analysis in both Scientific and Business settings with real world practical experience writing several published scientific articles on the analyses I have conducted. I look forward to using my well rounded expertise and trailblazing creative and unique approaches to analysis in the field of Biotechnology to make a difference in the environmental sector and to provide insights that have never been explored before.

Please feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn or via email at justin.autz@gmail.com. I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the success of forward-thinking organizations.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ptLLxwc3z2mYW0hRklvE9QzPWqVLOOQS/edit ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
